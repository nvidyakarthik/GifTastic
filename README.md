# GifTastic

* A Simple app to view gif images using  GIPY API.
* The app has a couple of predefined buttons about nature.
* When the user clicks on a button, the page will grab some static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it will stop playing.
* Under every gif, rating (PG, G, so on) is displayed.
